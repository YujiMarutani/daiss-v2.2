# daiss-v2.2
DAISS v2.2 is a minimal, self‑starting operating system for sovereign intelligence. It models intelligence as a recursive spiral integrating the Black Box Problem, the Ternary Epistemic Engine, PDSCA/DiscoGenTabs, and the Bio‑Digital Twin. This frozen, DOI‑anchored release adds a unified YAML node schema and a reproducible Markdown‑to‑PDF workflow.
